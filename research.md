# Research/Projects Experience

### 3D Reconstruction for TVAM 3D-Printed Sample  
**EPFL EEE Summer Project**  
**Advisor: Dr. Christophe Moser, EPFL**  
**June 2025 – Sep 2025 | Lausanne, Switzerland**  
- Built a custom multi-slice physical model for 3D Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM), and implemented full forward simulation and inverse reconstruction using the angular spectrum method.  
- Introduced implicit neural representations (INR) to replace voxel-based optimization, significantly enhancing reconstruction quality and reducing artifacts.  
- Currently preparing experimental validation using 3D-printed samples and a dual-view acquisition setup.

## Exploring the Performance of Coherent Ising Machine in weighted NP-Hard Problems
**Independent Study**
**Advisor: Jie Zhu, School of ECE, Purdue University**
**Dec 2022--Aug 2023**

- The Project's code and details can be viewed at the [GitHub project link](https://github.com/Wang-Zhiping/Exploring-the-Performance-of-Coherent-Ising-Machine-in-weighted-NP-Hard-Problems).
- Replicated prior research using an Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPO)-based coherent Ising machine for numerical simulations, utilizing theoretical equations, and applying the Runge-Kutta method to solve differential equations in Python.
- Utilized coherent Ising machine to address number partitioning problems and MAX-CUT in unweighted graphs, for the MAX-CUT problem, the success possibility of the Ising machine approach was higher.
- Applied the MaxCut problem to weighted graphs and found similar trends, suggesting that the success possibility might be associated with the weights.

## Exploration of the nature and causes of candle flame oscillator
**Advisor: Dr. Ning Huang, School of Physical Science and Technology**
**Oct. 2020 – Sep. 2021**

- Searched the article to understand the conditions and root causes of the phenomenon of coupled flame oscillations when several candles are burned in close proximity to each other.
- Captured images and temperatures of the coupled oscillations and processed them with OpenCV to obtain theoretically relevant experimental data.
- Modeled and interpreted using thermodynamic fluid dynamics, and drawing conclusions.
- Participated in China Undergraduate Physics Tournament(Northwest Region) as a tournament topic and won the first prize in June 2021.
