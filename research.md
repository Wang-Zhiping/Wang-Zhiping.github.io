## Research on Fast Fourier Ptychographic Based on Illumination Control
**Research Internship**
**Supervisor: Dr. An Pan, Pioneering Interdiscipline Center of CAS**
**Aug 2023--present**

- Studied articles related to the principles of Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy and actively participated in experiments to gain insights into the details.
- Performed numerical simulations to assess the effect of various LED on image restoration, explored relevant literature and theory to seek support for reducing overlap rates; experiment still in the planning.

## Exploring the Performance of Coherent Ising Machine in weighted NP-Hard Problems
**Independent Study**
**Advisor: Jie Zhu, School of ECE, Purdue University**
**Dec 2022--Aug 2023**

- The Project's code and details can be viewed at the [GitHub project link](https://github.com/Wang-Zhiping/Exploring-the-Performance-of-Coherent-Ising-Machine-in-weighted-NP-Hard-Problems).
- Replicated prior research using an Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPO)-based coherent Ising machine for numerical simulations, utilizing theoretical equations, and applying the Runge-Kutta method to solve differential equations in Python.
- Utilized coherent Ising machine to address number partitioning problems and MAX-CUT in unweighted graphs, for the MAX-CUT problem, the success possibility of the Ising machine approach was higher.
- Applied the MaxCut problem to weighted graphs and found similar trends, suggesting that the success possibility might be associated with the weights.

## Reproduction of Reverse Design of Nano-Optical Structures By Neural Networks
**Research Assistant**
**Advisor: Dr. Hao Jia, Lanzhou University & KAUST**
**Apr 2022--Mar 2023**

- Carried out literature research on the reverse design methods for optoelectronics devices and their applications.
- Created an optical system employing a tandem architecture that combines forward modeling and inverse design based on the work of Yu Zongfu’s team.
- Coded in Python using TensorFlow to capture the trends mentioned in the paper using a small sample dataset.

## Palm print identification
**Advisor: Dr. Jizhao Liu, School of Information Science and Engineering**
**Nov. 2021 – Mar. 2022**

- The Project's code and details can be viewed at the [GitHub project link](https://github.com/Wang-Zhiping/palmprint-recognition).
- Learned common operations in machine learning and digital image processing, especially biometrics.
- Used various filters for feature extraction, and finally PCA is used for dimensionality reduction.
- Coded in Python using TensorFlow to capture the trends mentioned in the paper using a small sample dataset.
- Achieved a high success rate for the Hong Kong Polytechnic University open source database and part of the students' data recognition success.

## Exploration of the nature and causes of candle flame oscillator
**Advisor: Dr. Ning Huang, School of Physical Science and Technology**
**Oct. 2020 – Sep. 2021**

- Searched the article to understand the conditions and root causes of the phenomenon of coupled flame oscillations when several candles are burned in close proximity to each other.
- Captured images and temperatures of the coupled oscillations and processed them with OpenCV to obtain theoretically relevant experimental data.
- Modeled and interpreted using thermodynamic fluid dynamics, and drawing conclusions.
- Participated in China Undergraduate Physics Tournament(Northwest Region) as a tournament topic and won the first prize in June 2021.
