# About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I am Zhiping Wang, currently a junior undergraduate student at Lanzhou University, majoring in physics and will receive my Bachelor of Science degree in the fall semester of 2024. I have been actively involved in research projects, primarily in the field of **Computational Optics and Optical Imaging**. I have also taken a diverse range of courses in physics, optics, computers, and mathematics, and have been privileged to serve as a teaching assistant for some courses.

I am presently engaged in a research internship at the [Pioneering Interdiscipline Center](http://www.piclaboratory.com/) within the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My individual research project is **<i>Research on Fast Fourier Ptychography Based on Illumination Control</i>**, under the supervision of Dr. An Pan.

<!--
Since May of this year, I have been actively involved in an online research project on **Photoacoustic Imaging** under the guidance of Professor [Fei Gao](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=aDTizY8AAAAJ) at [HISLAB](http://www.hislab.cn/), ShanghaiTech University.

### Research Interests:<a name="RI"></a>
Computational optics, especially combined hardware and software optimization for more purposeful imaging results and the application in various fields
         
 In more specific terms, what particularly captivates my interest in **computational imaging** is:
 
+ **Computational (optical) imaging** 
+ **Biological imaging techniques and devices**
+ **New methodologies guiding optical design and imaging using AI**
+ **Astronomical instrument(Adaptive optics, others)**

         
These three areas --- all revolve around the fascinating intersection of optics and new methodologies. I believe that these areas share similarities on many levels, and they align with my primary interest in computational imaging.

### Hobbies:
Photography, travel, PFV, hiking, and marketing
